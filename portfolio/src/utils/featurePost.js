## Introduction

Welcome to the **Feature Showcase**! This post is designed to test every visual element of our blog engine. We want to ensure that *typography*, *spacing*, and *interactive elements* are working perfectly.

> **Note:** This blockquote style is used for important information. It should have a blue accent border and a subtle background.

## Typography and Hierarchy

This section tests the heading hierarchy and how it reflects in the sticky Table of Contents.

### Sub-heading Level 3
This is a standard paragraph under an H3. It should have slightly less top margin than an H2.

### Another Sub-heading
We are testing the spacing between these sections.

## Rich Content Types

We also support various rich content formats.

### Code Blocks
Here is a sample Javascript code block:

\`\`\`javascript
const greet = (name) => {
  console.log(\`Hello, \${name}!\`);
};

greet('Developer');
\`\`\`

### Lists
Here is an unordered list:
*   Item One
*   Item Two with *italic text*
*   Item Three

And an ordered list:
1.  First Step
2.  Second Step
3.  Third Step

## Images and Media

Images should be responsive and include a caption if provided.

## Deep Layout Test

Let's do a deep dive to test the scrolling behavior of the Table of Contents.

### Section 1.1
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

### Section 1.2
Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

### Section 1.3
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

## Conclusion

This concludes our feature test. If you can navigate to every section via the sidebar and everything looks beautiful, we are ready for launch! 🚀
